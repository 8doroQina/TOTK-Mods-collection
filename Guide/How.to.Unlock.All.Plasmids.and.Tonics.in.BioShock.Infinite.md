If you want to unleash the full potential of your powers in BioShock Infinite, you might be interested in unlocking all the plasmids and tonics in the game. Plasmids are special abilities that let you manipulate elements, such as fire, electricity, or telekinesis. Tonics are passive enhancements that boost your health, damage, or hacking skills.

However, not all plasmids and tonics are available through normal gameplay. Some of them require you to find hidden codes, complete side quests, or purchase them from vending machines. If you don't want to miss any of them, you can use a simple cheat to obtain them all at once.
 
Here's how to do it:
 
1. Make a text file and name it Plasmid.txt.
2. Open the file DefUser.ini, which is located in your BioShock Infinite installation folder, under Release.
3. Find a key that you want to bind the cheat to and set it to exec Plasmid.txt. For example, F10=exec Plasmid.txt.
4. Edit the text file you just made with any of the commands listed below and save it in the same folder as DefUser.ini.
5. Start the game and press the key you bound to exec Plasmid.txt.
6. Go to a gene bank and select your plasmids and tonics.

The commands for each plasmid and tonic are as follows:
